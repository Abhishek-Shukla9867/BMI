# BMI
 The BMI (Body Mass Index) project is a simple web-based application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to create an interactive BMI calculator that allows users to input their height and weight and receive information about their BMI along with a corresponding weight status category.
